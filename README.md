## Overview
This project aims to use exploratory data analysis on available movie data to make movie recommendations for key stakeholders. 

## Business Problems
In this scenario, Microsoft is creating a new movie studio and needs recommendations on the current box office. Our team plans to explore the current film industry examining the best type of films to create while providing other important insight on the movie industry.

## Data

![imdb](./images/imdb.jpg)

Our Data sets are derived from the following public databases:

[IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/) <br>
[The Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/) <br>
[Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/) <br>
[The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) <br>
[The Numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/) <br>
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/carolzhangdc/imdb-5000-movie-dataset)

## Methods
Our methods consisted of explorative data analysis techniques using panda data frames. We measured profibility across different genres, months, ratings, and directors. We also weighted the averages method to prevent outlyers from skewing our data. We also explored relationships of social media engagement in the form of Facebook Likes on it's affect on gross. 

## Results



## Conclusion
Our Key recommendations are the following
- **Movies are worthwhile investments at a 216% return on investment**
- **Musical, Horror, and Mystery are the 3 genres we recommend after assessing profiability and barrier of entry**
- **Recommended release date for the genre:**
        \t Musical: May, Nov,  and December
        \t Horror:  Apr, Jul and Oct
        \t Mystery:  Aug and May
- **Recommended director for the genre:**
        >Musical: Damien Chazzelle
        >Horror: William Brent Bell
        Mystery: John Leonetti

## Future Recommendations

We further recommend looking into socia media engagement for a success of a movie.  While we felt this aspect was important, public data was limited. We used facebook likes as our metric which showed a very weak correlation with our specific genre recommendation. With this we can infer that Facebook may not be the best place to market those musical, horror, or mystery films. Other social media platforms may be worth exploring in relation to a success of a movie.

The README should provide an overview of the project and repository structure
Files and folders should be organized to make it easy to find any necessary files
Commit history should reflect the project’s development history
