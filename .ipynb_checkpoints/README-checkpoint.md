Core data 
    •imdb.title.basics
    •imdb.title.ratings
    •bom.movie_gross

-After cleaning up bom.movie_gross data, and making a total gross column, I merged it with the titles and ratings files. There seems to be some problem merging where as the top grossing film was dropped? Have to re-visist. Made some quick graphs comparing categories to gross income. 
    Genre label ran into some problems due to how its organized in the table. 
    Year does not look like there is any relationship on a scatter plot
    num_votes looks like its positively correlated
    average rating looks like it has an affect as well.
